            <h2>Being a Dog Mom<hr></h2>
            <p>My son’s name is Reinhardt, named after my favorite Overwatch character. Reinhardt is a 45lb Aussiedoodle. He can be a little crazy since he’s only a 9 month old puppy and he’s a very energetic breed. He definitely keeps me entertained. He loves morning runs, afternoon walks, chicken, playing with other dogs, watching ducks, and puzzles. </p>

            <h2>Playing Soccer<hr></h2>
            <p>I played for four years at nova southeastern university in Fort Lauderdale. We won the south regional championship in 2019. I mostly play center defensive midfield but I can play any position on the field. I still play for fun but I love doing anything active. Most of my days include soccer, futsal, disc golf, and pickle ball. </p>

            <h2>Lifting Weights<hr></h2>
            <p>I love going to the gym! I go almost everyday. I’ve training for 5 years consistently, and I did competitive powerlifting for 2 years. I don’t compete anymore but eventually I would like to do a bodybuilding competition. My favorite muscle to hit is quads. </p>
